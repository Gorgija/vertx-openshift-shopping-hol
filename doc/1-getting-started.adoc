== Getting started

In this section we starts OpenShift locally on your machine using the CDK (a.k.a. Minishift). Then, we bootstrap the project we are going to use in this lab.

=== Prerequisites

* CDK has been installed
* `minishift` is available in the `$PATH`
* You have downloaded / unpack the lab content into a directory.

=== CDK setup

If you never run the CDK, you need to run the following command in a terminal / command line invite:

[source, bash]
----
minishift setup-cdk
----

When running this command, you will see in the output:

[source, bash]
----
...
Copying oc to '/Users/clement/.minishift/cache/oc/v3.5.5.8/oc'
...
----

Put the given path to your system `$PATH` - here `/Users/clement/.minishift/cache/oc/v3.5.5.8/`. `oc` is the OpenShift Client that will let us interact with OpenShift from the command line. Don't forget to restart your terminal once set.

=== Starting OpenShift

As we are using CDK, you have a Red Hat developer account. These credentials are required for this step.

In a terminal, execute:

[source, bash]
----
minishift start --username=<account-email> --password=<account-password>
----

This command can take a couple of minutes to complete. Once done check that everything has worked:

[source, bash]
----
> oc whoami
developer
> minishift console
----

This last command opens the browser to `https://192.168.64.12:8443/` (if the IP is not the same, use the address returned by the `minishift ip` command). In the browser, accept the connection despite the untrusted certificate. 

Once on the login page, enter `developer/developer` as credentials:

Once logged in, you should see the list of projects:

=== Creating a new project

We are going to create a new project to run our different microservices. In the same terminal, go to workshop location:

[source, bash]
----
oc new-project vertx-workshop
oc policy add-role-to-user view admin -n vertx-workshop
oc policy add-role-to-user view -n vertx-workshop -z default
oc policy add-role-to-group view system:serviceaccounts -n vertx-workshop
oc create -f scripts/templates/redis/redis.yaml
oc create -f scripts/templates/redis/redis-rc.yaml
oc create -f scripts/templates/redis/redis-service.yaml
cd pricer-service
mvn clean fabric8:deploy
----

The first command creates a new project named `vertx-workshop`. The commands 2 to 4 are setting the access on the different resources. The command 5 to 7 are deploying Redis. Finally, the 2 last commands builds and deploys a microservice we are going to use later.

Once done, if you go back to the browser, a second projects has been created: `vertx-workshop`. Click on it. You should see the different entities created:

=== What's next ?

We have know an environment ready to host our microservice, but something is missing... our microservices. That's the next link:2-the-application.adoc[step].
