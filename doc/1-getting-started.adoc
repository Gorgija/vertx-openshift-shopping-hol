== Getting started

=== Prerequisites

* Java 8 JDK installed
* Apache Maven 3.3.9+
* You have downloaded / unpack the lab content into a directory (called `$WORKSHOP_DIR` in the rest of the lab) .

=== Connecting to OpenShift

You will be assigned an id. Your account is `user$id`, for example, if you receive the id `0`, you will be `user0`.

In your browser (Google Chrome recommended), open https://35.197.63.242:8443 (ignore the certificate issues), and connect with `user$id` / `user$id`. For instance, `user1` / `user1`.

Then, click on the question mark (top right), and in the drop down menu select _Command Line Tools_. Click on the _Latest Release_ link. Scroll to the bottom the page, and download the `openshift-origin-client-tools` for your operating system. Unzip the package and place the `oc` executable in the system `$PATH`.

Then, go back to the OpenShift console (https://console.vertx-javaday-workshop.35.197.63.242.nip.io:8443/console/command-line), and copy the `oc login` command line.

[source, bash]
----
# Copy and paste the oc login command
> oc login https://console.vertx-javaday-workshop.35.197.63.242.nip.io:8443 --token=xxxxxxxxxxxx
The server uses a certificate signed by an unknown authority.
You can bypass the certificate check, but any data you send to the server could be intercepted by others.

Then, you should see the list of projects:

=== Creating a new project

We are going to use an already created project to run our different microservices. In the same terminal, navigate to `$WORKSHOP_DIR` and issue:

[source, bash]
----
oc project user$id # be sure to pass the right id
oc policy add-role-to-user view admin -n user$id
oc policy add-role-to-user view -n user$id -z default
oc policy add-role-to-group view system:serviceaccounts -n user$id
oc create -f scripts/templates/redis/redis.yaml
oc create -f scripts/templates/redis/redis-rc.yaml
oc create -f scripts/templates/redis/redis-service.yaml
cd pricer-service
mvn clean fabric8:deploy
----

The commands 2 to 4 are setting the permissions on the different resources. The commands 5 to 7 are deploying Redis (we are going to use Redis later). Finally, the 2 last commands build and deploys a microservice we are going to use later.

Once done, if you go back to the browser, and click on your project `user$id`. Click on it. You should see the different entities created:

=== What's next ?

We have an environment ready to host our microservice, but something is missing... our microservices. That's the next link:2-the-application.adoc[step].
